# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```


<!-- STEP 1 : DEPLOY ETH TOKENS AND BNB TOKENS

STEP 2 : DEPLOY ETH Bridge and BNB Bridge

STEP 3 : GIVE MINT AND BURN ROLE TO Bridge contract in both the chain

STEP 4 :  -->
